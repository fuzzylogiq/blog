# Slides from my talk at macad.uk
A couple of days ago I gave a talk to the [Mac Admin and Developer Conference](https://macad.uk) in London on the past, present and (not terribly long) future of macOS Server, and how you might plan to move away from it.

The slides are up on my github talks repo at https://github.com/fuzzylogiq/talks/blob/master/MACADUK-20180220/The_Sky_Is_Falling.pdf

Be warned, they're 42MB!

It was a great conference, as any meeting of our brilliant community tends to be. If you're wondering if you should attend one of these events, if you can afford it, you really should! They're invaluable occasions to talk, listen and learn.
